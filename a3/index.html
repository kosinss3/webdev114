				<h3>You should know about water.</h3>
				<p>
					Even though 70% of the earth is covered in water (there is an astonishing <strong>332.5 million cubic miles</strong> of water on Earth), only about 2.5% of that water is fresh water. Of that fresh water only about 1% of it is easily accessible. Most of the world's fresh water is either trapped underground, or frozen in glaciers. Despite the fact that only a small amount of the water in the world is fresh water and is easily accessible there is still enough water to sustain a multitude of life.

					Water is so ubiquitous that oftentimes we neglet to give it a fair share of our attention, <em>perhaps it's part of human nature to take things for granted</em>. It is estimated that as much as 50% of people don't drink enough water on a daily basis. Dehydration is a common cause for many common daily health issues, such as dizziness, fainting, headaches, rapid heartrate, dry skin, fatigue,  and confusion. Recognizing when your body is thirsty is the key to adequate hydration. There are many signs, including the previously listed symptoms, along with things like yellow urine, and dry mouth. When your body is thirsty it's time to drink some water!
