			<p>
				Alocasia, like many commonly kept house plants is a tropical plant that grows on the rainforest floor. This allows them to thrive in bright indirect sunlight. The leaves can grow to almost 3 feet long. Alocasia bears a small flower.
			</p>

			<p>
				Alocasia Amazonica has striking, colorful foliage. Some Alocasia grow to be quite large, however this one is less than a foot tall. It currently has three new leaves that have been unfurling for close to a month now. I'm not sure if it's supposed to take that long or if I should find a brighter home for it. Anyway, I'll make that decision another time.
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite the name "Amazonica", Alocasia is actually native to the tropics of Asia and Oceania. It got the name because it is actually a human-cultivated hybrid plant. This has probably led to its popularity as a house plant.
