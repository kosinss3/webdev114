			<p>
				One of my favorite houseplants, Monstera Deliciosa is a flowering plant that is native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. The "deliciosa" part of it's name means delicious, and refers to the edible fruit that the plant bears. Monstera Deliciosa is an epiphytic plant, meaning that it grows on the surface of another plant and it gets its moisture and nutrients from the surrounding air and debris.
			</p>

			<p>
				Monstera Deliciosa makes a good house plant due to its relatively low light tolerance. It is also tolerant to a wide range of temperatures, from the low 60s to high 80s Farenheit. Monstera can grow up to 66 feet tall in its natural habitat, however it rarely reaches heights greater than 10 feet indoors.
			</p>

			<p>
				I bought this particular Monstera a few months ago when I found it on sale at <a href="https://www.shopsteins.com/">Stein's</a>. At the time of purchase it was not looking great, as a matter of fact it still doesn't look all that healthy. I have repotted it twice since I first brought it home, most recently at the beginning of July. The first repotting was to get it out of the nursery pot and into the faux terracotta pot that it's in now. The second time I repotted due to soil drainage issues. Hopefully this most recent repotting will help it to perk up a bit.
