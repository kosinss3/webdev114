			<p>
				This Pothos is currently my favorite of my house plants. It is in a period of rapid growth that makes it fun to watch. In the last 3 weeks it has added 3 new leaves to all of the longest vines. That adds up to almost a foot of growth in less than a month! I actually couldn't fit the whole plant in the picture. And they say watching plants grow is boring...

			<p>
				Jade Pothos is actually a specific variety of plant with the scientific name Epipremnum aureum. It is native to the island of Mo'orea in the Society Islands. It has become naturalized to much of the tropical world.

			<p>
				Besides the fact that Pothos is tolerant to a wide variety of conditions, one of the things that make it a great house plant is its ease of propagation. Any time you might want to trim back an unruly vine you can always <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Propagate-a-Pothos-Plant/">propagate</a> each of the leaves that are on the piece that you cut off. This also stimulates the growth of the rest of the plant.
