			<p>
				Staghorn ferns are an epiphytic plant native to the tropics. This specific staghorns scientific name is Platycerium bifurcatum and is native to Australia and New Guinea.
			</p>

			<p>
				I first became facinated with staghorn ferns when I lived in Florida and was introduced to some truly <a href="../images/example.jpg">massive specimens</a>. The first staghorn fern I ever saw was hanging from a heavy duty tractor chain, over three feet in diameter, and probably weighed over 200 pounds. I was immediately captivated by its bizzare look.
			</p>

			<p>
				Staghorns, and ferns in general, can be very temperamental when keeping them as house plants, however this particular one seems to be thriving in the place I've given it on my bookshelf.
